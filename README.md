# Board-Game-Review-Prediction

Reviews can make or break a product; as a result, many companies take drastic measures to ensure that their product receives good reviews. When it comes to board games, reviews and word-of-mouth are everything. In this project, we will be using a linear regression model to predict the average review a board game will receive based on characteristics such as minimum and maximum number of players, playing time, complexity, etc.

This is short and concise Machine Learning Project, we will focus on predicting the reviews of over 80,000 different board games. This project based course is a fun way for you to master two important Machine Learning algorithms that can be applied on a much grander scale to other data sets - Linear Regression Model and a Random Forest Regressor.

for this project we will focus on board games. The information that we will work on was scrubbed from a database of 80,000 board games and includes information such as minimum players, maximum players, minimum playtime, maximum playtime, etc. We will use the models to ensure that using all of this information, it gives an accurate prediction regarding the reviews.

In this project, we will walk through all of the steps needed to generate this output including how to train the models, how to load and preprocess the dataset appropriately, and so much more. At the end of this project, we will not only have an accurate prediction of the board game reviews, but also hands-on experience to learn how you can actually train two significant Machine Learning algorithms to learn and sort data, as well as make accurate predictions using a data set.

## Requirements
Before we get started, we will need to clone a GitHub repository that contains the data set we will be using. This can be accomplished by installing git, an incredibly useful tool, or by simply downloading the repository using the link provided. Git can be installed by issuing the following command in the terminal:

conda install -c anaconda git

git clone https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers.git
